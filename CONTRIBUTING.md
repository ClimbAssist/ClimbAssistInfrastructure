Contributing
------------

Thanks for considering contributing to Climb Assist! This is a big endeavor and we need help from folks like you to make
it great. We're new to being open source, so please let us know if you have any suggestions on how we can make things
better.

I Have a Bug/Feature Request
----------------------------

Great! We have a few places to submit issues:
* For front-end bugs/feature requests, submit it [here](https://github.com/ClimbAssist/ClimbAssistUI/issues/new).
* For back-end bugs/feature requests, submit it [here](https://github.com/ClimbAssist/ClimbAssistService/issues/new).
* For deployment-related bugs/feature requests (seems a little unlikely but hey), submit it 
[here](https://github.com/ClimbAssist/ClimbAssistInfrastructure/issues/new).

If it's a bug, be sure to include the date and time when you experienced, as well as reproduction steps. If it's a
feature request, try to be crisp and break it into manageable tasks. We only have a couple maintainers right now, so
we can't guarantee that we will be able to look at it right away, but we'll do our best!

I Want to Help
--------------

Lovely! This repository is specifically for the toolchain infrastructure (deployment process) of Climb Assist, so this
is a bit of a niche place to contribute. If you're looking to help with back-end development, head over to
[ClimbAssistService](https://github.com/ClimbAssist/ClimbAssistService). If you're more interested in front-end
development, check out [ClimbAssistUI](https://github.com/ClimbAssist/ClimbAssistUI). Most of the work in this
repository is to support features in the other repositories.
 
Check out the [README](README.md) for details on cloning, running, and testing. In general, features should be
implemented in a new branch, and if they correspond with a bug/feature request, it's useful to include the tracking
number in the branch name. Once you've made code changes and you're confident that they
work, submit a pull request and one of our moderators will take a look at it as soon as they can. We only have a couple
maintainers right now, so it might take some time before your request can be looked at, but we promise we will review
it as soon as we can!

I Want to Help but I Don't Know Anything About Climbing!
--------------------------------------------------------
That's fine! You don't need a super in-depth knowledge of climbing to help. At least 50% of Climb Assist has
nothing to do with climbing. Dive right in!

That being said, hit us up some time if you want an intro to climbing :)

I Want to Help but I Don't Know How to Code!
--------------------------------------------
That's fine too! We have lots of ways for non-developers to help. Checkout the 
[contribution page](https://climbassist.com/contribute) on the website for more information.

Roadmap
-------

We don't have a specific roadmap for this repository because this one doesn't have any user-facing systems in it. Check
out our other repositories for some features we're hoping to add soon!
